# question-paper-repo
This repository serves to archive the question papers and exericses sheets used in all of the courses offered in IISER-M. 

These papers have been collated by the help of a large number of students over the past several years. As a result, a lot of them may not be of OCR quality and might also not be in .pdf format.

If you wish to contribute to the repository, make a pull request or contact the owners of this repository/part of the IISER-M Github organization.

For an even older archive, see ![link](https://iiserm.github.io/course_files/)
